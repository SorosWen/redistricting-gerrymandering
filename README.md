# redistricting-gerrymandering
This project aims to enhance transparency in the redistricting process by exploring algorithms related to gerrymandering through simulations. It focuses on dividing precincts on a map into defined partitions that are physically continuous and population-equivalent. The repository includes demo files for testing and plans for future development of an application that simulates political polling, court friendly aggressive/subtle gerrymandering. Users can run the demos of existing functionalities by navigating to the ./demos directory and executing the provided scripts.

### Demo
There are a few demo files inside the demos folder. Navigate to the ./demos directory and run python3 <filename>.
