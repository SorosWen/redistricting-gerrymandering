# redistricting-gerrymandering
In development. This repo is meant to explore several algorithm that are related gerrymandering and redistricting, through hypothetical scenarios. This repo will also explore several extreme cases and test the limit of algorithms. In the long term I wish to develop some sort of application that simulate political polling.
