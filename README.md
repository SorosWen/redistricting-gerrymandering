# redistricting-gerrymandering
In development. This package development is aimed to bring more transparency in the redictricting process. 

This repo is meant to explore several algorithm that are related to gerrymandering and redistricting, through simulations. 

This repo will also explore several extreme cases and test the limit of the algorithms. In the long term I wish to develop some sort of application that can simulate political polling as well. 

### Premise: 
- There are a numbers of precints in a map, each with different or identical populations.
- We want to divide precints in a map into a defined amount of partitions. 
- The partition has to be physically continuous and has equal amount of population. 
- Each precinct has a property indicating the voting preference of this precinct. This propery has a set of possible values. Each precinct can take on exactly one value at a time. 
- DominentPartition: meaning a partition such that > 50% of the population in the partition has the same property. 

### Demo
There are a few demo files inside the demos folder. Navigate to the ./demos directory and run python3 <filename>.
